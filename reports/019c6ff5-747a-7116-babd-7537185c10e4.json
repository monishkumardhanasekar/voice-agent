  "scores": {
    "task_resolution": {
      "score": 3,
      "reason": "The bot failed to confirm the refill or provide clear next steps, ending the call by connecting to a representative without resolution (Turn 20)."

    "comprehension_and_relevance": {
      "score": 5,
      "reason": "The bot understood the request for a refill but failed to address the issue of not finding the medication on file effectively, leading to an unresolved outcome (Turn 16)."

    "accuracy_and_consistency": {
      "score": 7,
      "reason": "The bot accurately repeated the medication name and dosage but failed to resolve the refill request due to system limitations (Turn 16)."
